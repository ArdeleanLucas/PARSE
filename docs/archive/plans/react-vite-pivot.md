# PARSE React + Vite Pivot — Historical Reference

> **Post-decomp note (2026-04-27):** pre-refactor file paths mentioned below may refer to barrels or orchestrator entrypoints rather than the concrete implementation files now used on `main`. Use [`docs/architecture/post-decomp-file-map.md`](/docs/architecture/post-decomp-file-map.md) as the canonical current-layout reference.


> **Status:** the React/Vite pivot has landed on `main`. This doc is kept as
> historical context only. It preserves the `js/` → React decomposition map
> (the mechanical migration checklist used during the pivot) so future work
> can verify that every legacy module has a typed React counterpart.
>
> The live API contract lives in **`AGENTS.md` § Client/Server Contract Surface**.
> Do not duplicate that table here — it drifts otherwise.

## Background (historical, for context)

- **Original scope:** replace the vanilla-JS monolith (36,951 lines across `parse.html`, `compare.html`, and 25 JS modules) with React + Vite, keeping the Python backend (`127.0.0.1:8766`) unchanged.
- **Execution:** dual-agent — ParseBuilder (Track A, Annotate) and Oda (Track B, Compare). Tracks agreed a shared contract up front, worked in parallel, and integrated after each track passed its own gates.
- **Constraint:** no emoji in the UI; annotation timestamps are immutable.
- **Result:** React SPA in `src/ParseUI.tsx` is the sole runtime frontend. Stage 3 / PR #58 removed the remaining vanilla-JS runtime (`js/`, `parse.html`, `compare.html`, `review_tool_dev.html`, legacy launchers).

Historical branch names like `feat/parse-react-vite`, `feat/annotate-react`, `feat/compare-react` referenced throughout the original plan are merged/deleted. Do not recreate them; branch new work from `origin/main`.

## `js/` → React migration map

Canonical record of which legacy module became which React surface. Every row has landed.

Stage 3 / PR #58 removed the left-column files from the live repo; the right column is the current runtime surface.
